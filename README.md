# FinalProject

This is the Final Project for Big Ideas for Group 19, which consists of members Diana Lysova (dil55@pitt.edu), Morgan Noonan (men83@pitt.edu), and Nick Nazari (nin45@pitt.edu).

The datasets used in this project are:
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-public-art
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playgrounds
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2

The goal of this project was to determine which neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the best one. The metric used was how many public open spaces each neighborhood had, specifically, how many parks, public art exhibitions, and playgrounds.
